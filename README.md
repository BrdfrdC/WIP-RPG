This is a project I started working on to brush up on C++. A make file is provided but I'm not entirely confident in its ability to compile, since I used mingw on Windows to compile the source code for me.

Currently, players can only attack with one attack and there are only 2 enemies. Trying to choose anything other than attack will lead to you skipping your turn. You also can't regain HP.

I'll slowly be adding new content over time, but this is just something for fun.

Features to add:
-Spells
-Items
-Running
-HP regeneration
-XP and Leveling up

Things that would be cool:
-Different attacks
-Spells with status effects
-Armor
-Class system
